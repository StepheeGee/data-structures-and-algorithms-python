# Array Binary Search

## Overview

Implement a function called `BinarySearch` that takes in a sorted array and a search key. The function returns the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key. If the element is not in the array, it returns -1.

## Approach & Efficiency

For the `BinarySearch` function:

- Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
- Enter a loop until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- Calculate the middle index as `(low + high) // 2`.
- Compare the element at the middle index with the search key.
  - If they are equal, return the middle index.
  - If the middle element is less than the search key, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
  - If the middle element is greater than the search key, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
- If the loop completes without finding the search key, return -1.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) - Binary search divides the search space in half at each step.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables regardless of the input size.

## Example

```python
from binary_search import BinarySearch

sorted_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
search_key = 7
result = BinarySearch(sorted_array, search_key)
print(f"Index of {search_key} in the array:", result)  # Output: Index of 7 in the array: 6
```

This example demonstrates the usage of the `BinarySearch` function with a sorted array and a search key, returning the index of the key in the array or -1 if not found.
